# Memory Game

This is the third FEND project for the Udacity course. The code started from scratch, with 16 cards and 8 different photos of a Spanish youtuber, instead of some stock and repetitive icons.

The game can be played here: https://jmedinilla.github.io/FEND-Memory_Game

## Instructions

- Click on the different card to play the game
- Press the restart button to reset everything on screen

## Expectations for the user

The game uses 16 cards and 8 different images to play a simple memory game. After 2 clicks you make a move, and after some specific moves, you start losing score stars.
