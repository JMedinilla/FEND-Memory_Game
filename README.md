# Memory Game

This is the third FEND project for the Udacity course. The code started from scratch, with 16 cards and 8 different photos of a Spanish youtuber, instead of some stock and repetitive icons.

## Instructions

-   The 16 cards have a generic click event that will make some game logic
-   The timer starts when the user clicks on the very first card
-   A move is done each time the user open 2 closed cards
-   You get 3 stars if the game is done in 10 or less moves, 2 stars from 20 to 11 moves, 1 star from 30 to 21 moves, and none if you bring shame to your family honor having to make more than 31 moves to finish the game
-   There is a restart button at the bottom of the game table
